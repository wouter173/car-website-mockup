<small>UI/ UX design for a car company that sells electric cars.</small>
Live version [here](https://wouterdb.nl).

### Designer

Designed and built by [Wouter de Bruijn](https://wouterdb.nl).

The mockup was built in react using create-react app, and styled with scss.
It was not pre-designed, meaning I just designed and styled it as I went building it with react.
I used scss because I had a lot of nested styles which I like to organize using Sass with scss.

I used font awesome icons in the mockup because they had everything I needed and integrated seamlessly in the already existing project.
I accessed the icons via the [@fortawesome/react-fontawesome](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fortawesome/react-fontawesome) package on npm.

### Info
